# Working with a local clone of the repository LinuxONE-ECC

## Installing the Git command
To install the git functions, please enter the following command:

## Cloning the Git repository
To work the lab materials, please enter the following command:
```
git clone https://github.com/IBM/ibm-z-elliptic-curve-cryptography.git
```
## Browsing the local clone of the git repository LinuxONE-ECC
Let see together that nothing is missing. Please issue the following command:
```
ls
```
A directory name ***ibm-z-elliptic-curve-cryptography** is now available. Please let go inside this repository by issuing the following command:
```
cd ibm-z-elliptic-curve-cryptography
```
Let see together that nothing is missing. Please issue the following command:
```
ls
```

In the directory **/RSA** you will find a set of script allowing you to generate RSA keys, to perform a digital signature, and verify a digital signature.

In the directory **/ECC** you will find a set of script allowing you to generate ECC keys, to perform a digital signature, and verify a digital signature.

You are now ready to go the [Step 2](https://github.com/IBM/ibm-z-elliptic-curve-cryptography/blob/master/rsa-lab.md).
